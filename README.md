# Oracle APEX Template Plugin: Text Field
This is a template for a simple Text Field page item.

The behavior should be virtually the same as the native component.

You can use this template as a starting point for your own plugin.

Don't forget to change the internal name of the plugin before you use it the first time, or it won't be changeable afterwards.
